-- Exercise 1: DVD Rentals

-- 1️ Get all rentals which are out (not returned)
SELECT *
FROM rental
WHERE return_date IS NULL;

-- 2️ Get all customers who have not returned their rentals, grouped by customer
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, COUNT(r.rental_id) AS outstanding_rentals
FROM customer c
JOIN rental r ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
WHERE r.return_date IS NULL
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name;

-- 3️ Get all Action films with Joe Swank
SELECT f.title, f.description, a.first_name, a.last_name
FROM film f
JOIN film_actor fa ON f.film_id = fa.film_id
JOIN actor a ON fa.actor_id = a.actor_id
JOIN film_category fc ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
JOIN category c ON fc.category_id = c.category_id
WHERE c.name = 'Action' AND a.first_name='Joe' AND a.last_name='Swank';

-- Optional shortcut: create a view for outstanding rentals
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW outstanding_rentals AS
SELECT r.rental_id, r.rental_date, r.inventory_id, r.customer_id
FROM rental r
WHERE r.return_date IS NULL;

JOIN country co ON ci.country_id = co.country_id;

-- 2️ Total viewing hours per store (sum of length of inventory items)
-- Exclude items not yet returned
SELECT s.store_id, SUM(f.length) AS total_minutes,
